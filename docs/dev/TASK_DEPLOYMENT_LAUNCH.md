# Task: Deployment and Launch Plan

This document outlines the process and checklist for deploying the SIP+ Visit Tracking System to a production environment.

## 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] **Code Freeze**: Announce a code freeze to prevent new features or major changes from being merged into the main branch.
- [ ] **Final Testing**: Complete all testing phases (Unit, Integration, E2E, UAT) and ensure all critical bugs are resolved.
- [ ] **Dependency Audit**: Review all project dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them if necessary.
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Ensure that all required environment variables for the production environment are set up and securely stored in the deployment platform (e.g., Vercel).
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `VITE_ALLOWED_SIGNUP_DOMAINS`
- [ ] **Database Migration**: Confirm that the production Supabase database is up-to-date with the latest schema (`schema.sql` and subsequent migration scripts).

## 2. Deployment Process

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel.

1.  **Merge to Main**: Ensure that the `main` branch contains the final, tested, and approved version of the code.
2.  **Trigger Deployment**: Push the final commit to the `main` branch. Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment.
3.  **Monitor Build**: Observe the build process in the Vercel dashboard to ensure it completes successfully.
4.  **Verify Deployment**: Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide a unique URL for the new version. Access this URL to perform smoke testing.

## 3. Post-Deployment (Launch)

- [ ] **Smoke Testing**: Perform a quick round of testing on the production environment to verify that all critical functionalities are working as expected.
  - [ ] Test user login and registration.
  - [ ] Create a new visit and fill out a section of the form.
  - [ ] Upload an image.
  - [ ] Generate a PDF report.
- [ ] **Update DNS (if applicable)**: If using a custom domain, point the domain to the new Vercel deployment.
- [ ] **Announce Launch**: Inform all stakeholders and end-users that the new version is live.
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Actively monitor the application for any unexpected errors or performance issues using Vercel Analytics and any other configured monitoring tools.

## 4. Rollback Plan

In case of a critical issue in the production environment, Vercel's deployment history allows for a quick rollback:

1.  Navigate to the project's **Deployments** tab in Vercel.
2.  Select the last known stable deployment.
3.  Use the **Redeploy** option to instantly roll back to the previous version.
