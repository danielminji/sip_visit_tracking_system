# UI/UX Requirements: SIP+ Visit Tracking System

This document outlines the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) requirements for the SIP+ Visit Tracking System. The goal is to create a modern, intuitive, and efficient interface for education officers.

## 1. General Principles

- **Clarity**: The interface should be clean, uncluttered, and easy to understand. Information should be presented in a clear and concise manner.
- **Consistency**: UI elements, such as buttons, forms, and navigation, should be consistent throughout the application.
- **Efficiency**: The application should be designed to minimize the number of clicks and steps required to complete common tasks.
- **Responsiveness**: The layout must adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 2. UI Components and Styling

- **Component Library**: The application will use `shadcn/ui` for its base components. This provides a set of accessible and customizable components.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS will be used for styling, allowing for a utility-first approach that is both flexible and maintainable.
- **Theme**: A professional and clean theme will be used, with a consistent color palette and typography.

## 3. Key Screens and Workflows

### 3.1. Login and Signup

- **Layout**: Simple, centered forms for login and registration.
- **Fields**: Standard fields for email and password.
- **Feedback**: Clear error messages for incorrect credentials or validation failures.

### 3.2. Dashboard / Landing Page

- **Navigation**: A clear and prominent navigation bar providing access to all major sections of the application (Schools, Visit History, etc.).
- **Overview**: The dashboard should provide a quick overview of recent activity or key information.

### 3.3. Visit Form

- **Layout**: A multi-step or tabbed interface to guide the user through the different SIP+ standards.
- **Input Fields**: A mix of text areas, dropdowns, and radio buttons for scoring.
- **Image Upload**: An intuitive drag-and-drop area for uploading evidence images, with progress indicators and clear feedback on success or failure.
- **Saving Progress**: The form should auto-save progress or provide a clear save button to prevent data loss.

### 3.4. Visit History

- **Layout**: A table or card-based layout to display a list of past visits.
- **Information**: Each entry should display key information such as school name, visit date, and the number of uploaded images.
- **Functionality**: Users should be able to search and filter the visit history.

### 3.5. PDF Reports

- **Generation**: A simple button to trigger the generation of PDF reports.
- **Preview**: If possible, a preview of the generated PDF should be displayed before downloading.

## 4. Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements should be accessible and operable via the keyboard.
- **Screen Readers**: The application should be compatible with screen readers, with appropriate ARIA labels and roles.
- **Color Contrast**: Text and background colors should have sufficient contrast to be easily readable.
