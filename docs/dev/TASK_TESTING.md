# Task: Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for the SIP+ Visit Tracking System to ensure its quality, reliability, and correctness.

## 1. Testing Objectives

- To verify that all functional requirements are met.
- To ensure the application is free of critical bugs and defects.
- To validate that the user experience is smooth and intuitive.
- To confirm that the system is secure and performant under expected load.

## 2. Levels of Testing

### 2.1. Unit Testing

- **Goal**: To test individual components and functions in isolation.
- **Tools**: A testing framework like Vitest or Jest would be suitable.
- **Scope**:
  - Utility functions (e.g., date formatting, data transformation).
  - Small, reusable UI components.
  - State management logic.

### 2.2. Integration Testing

- **Goal**: To test the interaction between different parts of the application.
- **Scope**:
  - **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Verify that the frontend correctly communicates with the Supabase API. This includes testing form submissions, data fetching, and file uploads.
  - **Component Integration**: Test how complex components, composed of smaller units, work together.
  - **PDF Generation**: Ensure that the `pdf-lib` integration correctly generates PDFs with dynamic data.

### 2.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- **Goal**: To test complete user workflows from start to finish, simulating real-world usage.
- **Tools**: A framework like Cypress or Playwright could be used for E2E testing.
- **Key Scenarios**:
  1.  **User Registration and Login**: A new user registers, logs in, and is taken to the dashboard.
  2.  **Complete Visit Assessment**: An officer logs in, creates a new visit, fills out all sections of the form for one standard, uploads an image, saves the visit, and generates a PDF report.
  3.  **Visit History Navigation**: An officer logs in, navigates to the visit history, searches for a specific visit, and opens it for review.

### 2.4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

- **Goal**: To validate that the system meets the needs and expectations of the end-users.
- **Process**: A group of target users (Education Officers) will be given access to the application and a set of tasks to perform. Their feedback will be collected and used to make final adjustments.

## 3. Testing Checklist
