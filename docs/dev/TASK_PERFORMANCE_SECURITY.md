# Task: Performance and Security Plan

This document outlines the strategy for ensuring the SIP+ Visit Tracking System is performant, secure, and reliable.

## 1. Performance

### 1.1. Goals

- **Fast Initial Load**: The application should load quickly for first-time users.
- **Responsive UI**: User interactions should feel instantaneous, with no noticeable lag.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Data-heavy operations like fetching visit history or generating PDFs should be optimized.

### 1.2. Key Areas of Focus

- **Code Bundling and Splitting**: Vite automatically handles code splitting, ensuring that users only download the code they need for the current page.
- **Image Optimization**: Images should be optimized before or during upload to reduce their file size without significant loss of quality. This will improve load times for pages with many images.
- **Data Caching**: TanStack Query (React Query) is used to cache server state. This reduces the number of redundant API calls and makes the application feel faster.
- **Lazy Loading**: Components or pages that are not immediately needed can be lazy-loaded to improve the initial load time.

### 1.3. Performance Testing

- **Tools**: Use browser developer tools (Lighthouse, Performance tab) to analyze load times, rendering performance, and identify bottlenecks.
- **Metrics**: Track key performance metrics such as First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and Time to Interactive (TTI).

## 2. Security

### 2.1. Goals

- **Data Confidentiality**: Ensure that user data is protected from unauthorized access.
- **Data Integrity**: Prevent unauthorized modification of data.
- **System Availability**: Protect the system from attacks that could disrupt service.

### 2.2. Key Security Measures

- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication is handled by Supabase Auth. All sensitive operations require a valid user session.
- **Authorization (Row Level Security)**: This is the most critical security feature of the application. RLS policies are implemented at the database level in Supabase to ensure that users can only access and modify their own data. This prevents data leakage between users.
- **Input Validation**: All user input is validated using Zod schemas before being processed. This helps prevent injection attacks and ensures data consistency.
- **Environment Variable Security**: Sensitive information like API keys is stored in environment variables and is not exposed on the client-side.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly audit and update dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities.
- **HTTPS**: All communication with the Supabase backend is over HTTPS, encrypting data in transit.

### 2.3. Security Testing

- **RLS Policy Review**: Regularly review and test Supabase RLS policies to ensure they are correctly enforced.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use automated tools to scan for common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).
- **Penetration Testing (Future)**: For high-security requirements, consider conducting a formal penetration test.
